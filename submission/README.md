## Build Instructions

You need to first create the COVID-19 conda environment by the given
`environment.yml` file, which provides the name and necessary packages for this
tasks. If you have `conda` properly installed, you may create, activate or
deactivate the environment via the following commands:

```
conda env create 
conda activate covid19
conda deactivate
```
OR 

```
conda env create --name NAMEOFYOURCHOICE -f environment.yml
conda activate NAMEOFYOURCHOICE
conda deactivate
```

To view the list of your environments, use the following command:
```
conda env list
```

More useful information about managing environments can be found
[here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

You may also quickly review the usage of basic Python and Numpy package, if
needed in grading our assignment.

To generate our predictions for Part 1, run `python round1.py`. The resulting
predictions will be stored in `./round1.csv`.

To generate our predictions for Part 2, run `python round2.py`. The resulting
predictions will be stored in `./round2.csv`.
